This directory contains Barrett Technology's Teach and Play Suite.

** Note: This software will only work with WAM firmware versions >= 200 **

Recommendation: Any time the load present at the end-effector is changed, run the following routines:
$ bt-wam-gravitycal
$ ./bt-wam-ccg

Files:

control_mode_switcher.h - Header file containing convenient calls to switch between current and voltage control modes.

calibrate_control_gains.cpp - Routine to calibrate the control gains for use of the WAM in voltage control mode. After compilation, this routine is run with the command ./bt-wam-ccg

calibration4.conf & calibration7.conf - Configuration files loaded at runtime containing gain information necessary for playback.

teach.cpp - Program to record and save a trajectory based on human interaction with the WAM. The trajectories can be saved in joint or Cartesian space.

play.cpp - Program to load and play back a trajectory. Playback is capable of playing back joint or Cartesian trajectories in either current or voltage control.

Instructions:

Compile all files in the directory - 
$ cmake .
$ make

Calibrate the control gains - 
$ ./bt-wam-ccg

Teach a Trajectory -
$ ./teach <Name_of_file> <jp / pose>
ex: 
$ ./teach figure_eight pose
This will prompt the user to press enter to start teaching the WAM a trajectory in Cartesian space. A trajectory will be recorded at 500Hz. 
After the user completes the trajectory, they press enter again to stop teaching the trajectory.
The trajectory will be saved in the recorded directory as a .csv file.

The default is to record in joint space.

Play a Trajectory - 
$ ./play <Path_to_file> <cc / vc>
ex:
$ ./play recorded/figure_eight.csv cc
The trajectory will be loaded and the user will be prompted with the following options:
p - Play - Plays back the trajectory once.
i - Pause - Pauses the trajectory playback.
s - Stop - Stops the trajectory playback.
l - Loop - Continuously playback the trajectory.
q - Quit - Stops the playback, sends the robot home, and prompts the user to shift-idle.
[Enter] - Pressing enter at any time will open or close the hand if present.

The default is to playback the trajectory in current control mode.
