/* ex02_hold_position.cpp
 *
 * This example turns on gravity compensation and then allows the user to
 * constrain the position of the arm using various controllers.
 *
 * Gravity compensation uses cumulative first-moment of mass data (stored in
 * the configuration files in /etc/barrett/) to calculate in real time what
 * torques should be applied to the motors in order to support the arm's weight
 * in gravity. Gravity compensation is typically used in combination with other
 * control strategies; gravity compensation keeps the arm from falling, while
 * the other control strategies make it do something interesting. Unless you
 * have a specific reason not to, you should turn gravity compensation on at
 * the beginning of a WAM program and leave it on for the duration. (Feel free
 * to experiment with how turning gravity compensation on and off affects the
 * WAM's behavior!)
 *
 * If you change the WAM's mass distribution (for instance, by attaching a tool
 * to the end), you'll need to recalibrate before gravity compensation will
 * behave correctly. To do this, run the bt-wam-gravitycal program and then
 * update the information in the appropriate configuration file. The gravity
 * compensation and calibration routines rely on having an accurately zeroed
 * robot, so consider performing zero calibration (bt-wam-zerocal) first. These
 * routines also rely on knowing the orientation of the WAM relative to
 * gravity. The default configuration files assume the WAM is in its standard
 * orientation (the plane containing the four mounting holes is horizontal).
 * Make sure to adjust the "world_to_base" homogeneous transform in the
 * configuration files if your WAM is mounted in a different orientation.
