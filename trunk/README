Some of these subdirectories contain Eclipse projects, but Eclipse's workspace metadata is not included in the repository. To regenerate it:

1) Open Eclipse
2) Set your Workspace directory to libbarrett/trunk (this folder)
3) Select File -> Import
4) Under the General category, choose "Existing Projects into Workspace", and then Next
5) Choose "Select root directory" and use libbarrett/trunk as the directory
6) At this point, the projects should be listed. Select them all and click Finish.

When this is completed, it sometimes looks as if nothing has changed. If this is the case, close the Welcome screen and/or choose Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> C/C++.

When committing, do not add the libbarrett/trunk/.metedata directory or any of the Release/Debug build directories to the repository. These directories should be ignored automatically.
