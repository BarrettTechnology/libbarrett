libbt examples directory
2008-09-30

This directory contains a set of separate example programs which use
the libbt library.

For now, these examples are not made by the build system (and therefore
have separate Makefiles).   I might add a --with-examples switch to
the configure at some point.

We place a couple of commonly-used wam.config files in the root examples
directory.  Link whichever you want to use to wam.config.
