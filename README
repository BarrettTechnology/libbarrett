Some of these subdirectories contain Eclipse projects, but Eclipse's workspace metadata is not included in the repository. To regenerate it:

1) Open Eclipse
2) Set your Workspace directory to libbarrett/trunk (this folder)
3) Select File -> Import
4) Under the General category, choose "Existing Projects into Workspace", and then Next
5) Choose "Select root directory" and use libbarrett/trunk as the directory
6) At this point, the projects should be listed. Select them all and click Finish.

When committing, do not add the libbarrett/trunk/.metedata directory to the repository. This directory should be ignored automatically.
