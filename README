**** Documentation ****

libbarrett is documented using in-code deoxygen comments. deoxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) is a source code documentation generator tool. To generate HTML documentation, run the 'deoxgygen' utility from the 'libbarrett/trunk' directory. The documentation will be in 'libbarrett/trunk/doc/html/index.html'.


**** Eclipse projects ****

Some of these subdirectories contain Eclipse projects, but Eclipse's workspace metadata is not included in the repository. To regenerate it:

1) Open Eclipse
2) Set your Workspace directory to 'libbarrett/trunk'
3) Select File -> Import
4) Under the General category, choose "Existing Projects into Workspace", and then Next
5) Choose "Select root directory" and use 'libbarrett/trunk' as the directory
6) At this point, the projects should be listed. Select them all and click Finish.

When this is completed, it sometimes looks as if nothing has changed. If this is the case, close the Welcome screen and/or choose Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> C/C++.


**** Note on generated files ****

When committing, do not add the 'libbarrett/trunk/.metedata' directory, any of the Release/Debug/Debug-local build directories, or any files under the 'libbarrett/trunk/doc' directory to the repository. These directories should be ignored automatically.
