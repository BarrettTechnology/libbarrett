**** Deploy Documentation ****

Edit DEBIAN/control to have the correct version and installed size. Edit deploy.sh to have the correct $dep_rev and $repo_base variables. Finally, execute the deploy.sh script.

The letters appended to the version string encode configuration options. 'x' stands for Xenomai, 's' stands for SocketCAN.
