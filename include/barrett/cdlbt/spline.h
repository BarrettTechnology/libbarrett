 * \section sec_intro Introduction
 *
 * A bt_spline is an abstraction over a set of GSL interpolators, one for each
 * dimension of the spline's space.  Points can be added to the spline as
 * vectors, and the spline can then be interpolated over in a control loop.
 * The spline can be parameterized by arclength or by an external parameter.

/** A bt_spline has two different parameterization modes, arclen and
 *  external.
 *
 * In BT_SPLINE_MODE_ARCLEN, the spline calculates the parameter s itself
 * once it is initialized, based on the linear distance between the points.
 * The resulting length is then available in the bt_spline::length variable.
 * In this mode the s parameter in the bt_spline_add() function is ignored.
 *
 * In BT_SPLINE_MODE_EXTERNAL, an external parameter is used.  This value is
 * saved along with each point through the s parameter of bt_spline_add().
 * The values start at zero when the starting point is added, and the
 * subsequent values used must be monotonically increasing as the points are
 * added. This mode is most often used with elapsed time serving as the
 * external parameter.
