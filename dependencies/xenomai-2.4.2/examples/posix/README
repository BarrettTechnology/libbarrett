About satch for POSIX
---------------------

The demo satch for POSIX is divided into two parts:
- one running as a kernel module and implementing the producer task;
- a second one executing in user space and running the consumer task.

The purpose of the demo is to exhibit POSIX shared memory and message
queues support since communication between kernel task and the user
space application involves both mecanisms.

Build the demo
--------------

Run "make all" to build both user-space application and kernel module.

Note that you can override xenomai search path and the kernel source
path using respectively "make XENO=..." and "make KSRC=..." 

Run satch
---------

Once satch and satch.ko have been built, you may want to edit a
.runinfo file to start and stop the demo in an easy manner.

echo 'satch:posix:push satch.ko;!./satch;popall:control_c' > .runinfo

$xenomai_installation_path/bin/xeno-load ./:satch
