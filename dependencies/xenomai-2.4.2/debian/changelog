xenomai (2.4.0-0+rc6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update prepare-patch.sh to use combined x86/i386 Xenomai tree.
  * Split patch generation out of build-stamp so that it only gets
    called once along with the configure.
  * In pursuit of silencing lintian:
    * Rename top level ChangeLog to changelog when installed.
    * Add ldconfig to post install/remove scripts.
    * Compress changelogs.

xenomai (2.3.50-01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial build.
  * General notes: prepare-patch.sh generates a per-kernel/arch
    for use with kernel-package - A single patch is needed for
    apply/unapply steps. The scripts/prepare-kernel.sh appends a
    few lines to some Makefiles which would cause problems on the
    unapply stage.
