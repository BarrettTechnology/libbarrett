 *
 * Clocks and timers services.
 *
 * Xenomai POSIX skin supports two clocks:
 *
 * CLOCK_REALTIME maps to the nucleus system clock, keeping time as the amount
 * of time since the Epoch, with a resolution of one system clock tick.
 *
 * CLOCK_MONOTONIC maps to an architecture-dependent high resolution counter, so
 * is suitable for measuring short time intervals. However, when used for
 * sleeping (with clock_nanosleep()), the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock has a resolution
 * of one system clock tick, like the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.
 *
 * Timer objects may be created with the timer_create() service using either of
 * the two clocks, but the resolution of these timers is one system clock tick,
 * as is the case for clock_nanosleep().
 *
 * @note The duration of the POSIX clock tick depends on the active
 * time base (configurable at compile-time with the constant @a
 * CONFIG_XENO_OPT_POSIX_PERIOD, and at run-time with the @a
 * xeno_posix module parameter @a tick_arg). When the time base is
 * aperiodic (which is the default) the system clock tick is one
 * nanosecond.
 *
 * @see
 * <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/xsh_chap02_08.html#tag_02_08_05">
