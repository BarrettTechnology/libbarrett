/**
 * @ingroup posix_thread
 * @defgroup posix_cancel Thread cancellation.
 *
 * Thread cancellation.
 *
 * Cancellation is the mechanism by which a thread can terminate the execution
 * of a Xenomai POSIX skin thread (created with pthread_create()). More
 * precisely, a thread can send a cancellation request to a Xenomai POSIX skin
 * thread and depending on its cancelability type (see pthread_setcanceltype())
 * and state (see pthread_setcancelstate()), the target thread can then either
 * ignore the request, honor it immediately, or defer it till it reaches a
 * cancellation point. When threads are first created by pthread_create(), they
 * always defer cancellation requests.
 *
 * When a thread eventually honors a cancellation request, it behaves as if
 * @a pthread_exit(PTHREAD_CANCELED) was called.  All cleanup handlers are
 * executed in reverse order, finalization functions for thread-specific data
 * are called, and finally the thread stops executing. If the canceled thread
 * was joinable, the return value PTHREAD_CANCELED is provided to whichever
 * thread calls pthread_join() on it. See pthread_exit() for more information.
 *
 * Cancellation points are the points where the thread checks for pending
 * cancellation requests and performs them.  The POSIX threads functions
 * pthread_join(), pthread_cond_wait(), pthread_cond_timedwait(),
 * pthread_testcancel(), sem_wait(), sem_timedwait(), sigwait(), sigwaitinfo()
 * and sigtimedwait() are cancellation points.
