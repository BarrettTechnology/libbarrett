menuconfig XENO_SKIN_RTDM
	depends on XENO_OPT_NUCLEUS
	tristate "Real-Time Driver Model"
	default y
	help

	This API skin allows to write real-time drivers against a common
	light weight interface in kernel mode, but use them across all other
	skins in both kernel and user mode.

if XENO_SKIN_RTDM

config XENO_OPT_RTDM_PERIOD
	int "Base period (us)" if XENO_OPT_TIMING_PERIODIC
	default 0
	help
	Duration of the base periodic tick (in microseconds).

	The RTDM skin can express all delays and timeouts either as
	counts of ticks (i.e. jiffy-based), or directly in
	nanoseconds in a tick-less fashion. This paramater defines the
	duration of the base period in microseconds; a null value
	selects the tick-less mode.

	The base period can be overriden at runtime using the
	"tick_arg" module parameter when loading the RTDM skin.

	If in doubt, leave zero in this field.

config XENO_OPT_RTDM_FILDES
	int "Maximum number of RTDM file descriptors"
	default 128
	help

	This option defines the maximum number of RTDM file descriptors
	which can be opened at the same time. RTDM file descriptors are
	a global resource all applications share, either via the RTDM skin
	directly or via the embedded services of the POSIX skin.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_RTDM
	bool "RTDM debugging support"
	depends on XENO_OPT_DEBUG
	default y
	help

	This option activates debugging checks for the RTDM subsystem.
	It is a recommended option for analysing potential issues in RTDM
	drivers. A minor runtime overhead is added.
