 * Message queueing is a method by which real-time tasks can exchange
 * or pass data through a Xenomai-managed queue of messages. Messages
 * can vary in length and be assigned different types or usages. A
 * message queue can be created by one task and used by multiple tasks
 * that send and/or receive messages to the queue.
 *
 * This implementation is based on a zero-copy scheme for message
 * buffers. Message buffer pools are built over the nucleus's heap
 * objects, which in turn provide the needed support for exchanging
 * messages between kernel and user-space using direct memory mapping.

 * @fn int rt_queue_create(RT_QUEUE *q,const char *name,size_t poolsize,size_t qlimit,int mode)
 *
 * @brief Create a message queue.
 *
 * Create a message queue object that allows multiple tasks to
 * exchange data through the use of variable-sized messages. A message
 * queue is created empty. Message queues can be local to the kernel
 * space, or shared between kernel and user-space.
 *
 * This service needs the special character device /dev/rtheap
 * (10,254) when called from user-space tasks.
 *
 * @param q The address of a queue descriptor Xenomai will use to store
 * the queue-related data.  This descriptor must always be valid while
 * the message queue is active therefore it must be allocated in
 * permanent memory.
 *
 * @param name An ASCII string standing for the symbolic name of the
 * queue. When non-NULL and non-empty, this string is copied to a safe
 * place into the descriptor, and passed to the registry package if
 * enabled for indexing the created queue. Shared queues must be given
 * a valid name.
 *
 * @param poolsize The size (in bytes) of the message buffer pool
 * which is going to be pre-allocated to the queue. Message buffers
 * will be claimed and released to this pool.  The buffer pool memory
 * is not extensible, so this value must be compatible with the
 * highest message pressure that could be expected.
 *
 * @param qlimit This parameter allows to limit the maximum number of
 * messages which can be queued at any point in time. Sending to a
 * full queue begets an error. The special value Q_UNLIMITED can be
 * passed to specify an unlimited amount.
 *
 * @param mode The queue creation mode. The following flags can be
 * OR'ed into this bitmask, each of them affecting the new queue:
 *
 * - Q_FIFO makes tasks pend in FIFO order on the queue for consuming
 * messages.
 *
 * - Q_PRIO makes tasks pend in priority order on the queue.
 *
 * - Q_SHARED causes the queue to be sharable between kernel and
 * user-space tasks. Otherwise, the new queue is only available for
 * kernel-based usage. This flag is implicitely set when the caller is
 * running in user-space. This feature requires the real-time support
 * in user-space to be configured in (CONFIG_XENO_OPT_PERVASIVE).
 *
 * - Q_DMA causes the buffer pool associated to the queue to be
 * allocated in physically contiguous memory, suitable for DMA
 * operations with I/O devices. A 128Kb limit exists for @a poolsize
 * when this flag is passed.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -EEXIST is returned if the @a name is already in use by some
 * registered object.
 *
 * - -EINVAL is returned if @a poolsize is null, greater than the
 * system limit, or @a name is null or empty for a shared queue.
 *
 * - -ENOMEM is returned if not enough system memory is available to
 * create or register the queue. Additionally, and if Q_SHARED has
 * been passed in @a mode, errors while mapping the buffer pool in the
 * caller's address space might beget this return code too.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service was called from an invalid
 * context.
 *
 * - -ENOSYS is returned if @a mode specifies Q_SHARED, but the
 * real-time support in user-space is unavailable.
 *
 * - -ENOENT is returned if /dev/rtheap can't be opened.
 *   
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - User-space task (switches to secondary mode)
 *
 * Rescheduling: possible.

/**
 * @fn ssize_t rt_queue_read(RT_QUEUE *q,void *buf,size_t size,RTIME timeout)
 *
 * @brief Read a message from a queue.
 *
 * This service retrieves the next message available from the given
 * queue. Unless otherwise specified, the caller is blocked for a
 * given amount of time if no message is immediately available on
 * entry. This services differs from rt_queue_receive() in that it
 * copies back the payload data to a user-defined memory area, instead
 * of returning a pointer to the message buffer holding such data.
 *
 * @param q The descriptor address of the message queue to read
 * from.
 *
 * @param buf A pointer to a memory area which will be written upon
 * success with the message contents. The internal message buffer
 * conveying the data is automatically freed by this call.
 *
 * @param size The length in bytes of the memory area pointed to by @a
 * buf. Messages larger than @a size are truncated appropriately.
 *
 * @param timeout The number of clock ticks to wait for some message
 * to arrive (see note). Passing TM_INFINITE causes the caller to
 * block indefinitely until some message is eventually
 * available. Passing TM_NONBLOCK causes the service to return
 * immediately without waiting if no message is available on entry.
 *
 * @return The number of bytes available from the received message is
 * returned upon success, which might be greater than the actual
 * number of bytes copied to the destination buffer if the message has
 * been truncated. Zero is a possible value corresponding to a
 * zero-sized message passed to rt_queue_send() or
 * rt_queue_write(). Otherwise:
 *
 * - -EINVAL is returned if @a q is not a message queue descriptor.
 *
 * - -EIDRM is returned if @a q is a deleted queue descriptor.
 *
 * - -ETIMEDOUT is returned if @a timeout is different from
 * TM_NONBLOCK and no message is available within the specified amount
 * of time.
 *
 * - -EWOULDBLOCK is returned if @a timeout is equal to TM_NONBLOCK
 * and no message is immediately available on entry.
 *
 * - -EINTR is returned if rt_task_unblock() has been called for the
 * waiting task before any data was available.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service should block, but was called
 * from a context which cannot sleep (e.g. interrupt, non-realtime or
 * scheduler locked).
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Interrupt service routine
 *   only if @a timeout is equal to TM_NONBLOCK.
 *
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task (switches to primary mode)
 *
 * Rescheduling: always unless the request is immediately satisfied or
 * @a timeout specifies a non-blocking operation.
 *
 * @note The @a timeout value will be interpreted as jiffies if the
 * native skin is bound to a periodic time base (see
 * CONFIG_XENO_OPT_NATIVE_PERIOD), or nanoseconds otherwise.

 * the queue does not exist on entry, this service blocks the caller
 * until a queue of the given name is created.
 *
 * @param name A valid NULL-terminated name which identifies the

 *
 * @param q The address of a queue descriptor retrieved by the
 * operation. Contents of this memory is undefined upon failure.
 *
 * @param timeout The number of clock ticks to wait for the
 * registration to occur (see note). Passing TM_INFINITE causes the
 * caller to block indefinitely until the object is
 * registered. Passing TM_NONBLOCK causes the service to return
 * immediately without waiting if the object is not registered on
 * entry.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -EFAULT is returned if @a q or @a name is referencing invalid
 * memory.
 *
 * - -EINTR is returned if rt_task_unblock() has been called for the
 * waiting task before the retrieval has completed.
 *
 * - -EWOULDBLOCK is returned if @a timeout is equal to TM_NONBLOCK
 * and the searched object is not registered on entry.
 *
 * - -ETIMEDOUT is returned if the object cannot be retrieved within
 * the specified amount of time.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service should block, but was called
 * from a context which cannot sleep (e.g. interrupt, non-realtime or
 * scheduler locked). This error may also be returned whenever the
 * call attempts to bind from a user-space application to a local
 * queue defined from kernel space (i.e. Q_SHARED was not passed to
 * rt_queue_create()).
 *
 * - -ENOENT is returned if the special file /dev/rtheap
 * (character-mode, major 10, minor 254) is not available from the
 * filesystem. This device is needed to map the memory pool used by
 * the shared queue into the caller's address space. udev-based
 * systems should not need manual creation of such device entry.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - User-space task (switches to primary mode)
 *
 * Rescheduling: always unless the request is immediately satisfied or
 * @a timeout specifies a non-blocking operation.
