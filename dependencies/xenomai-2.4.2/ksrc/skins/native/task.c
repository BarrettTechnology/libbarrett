 * Xenomai provides a set of multitasking mechanisms. The basic process
 * object performing actions in Xenomai is a task, a logically complete
 * path of application code. Each Xenomai task is an independent portion
 * of the overall application code embodied in a C procedure, which
 * executes on its own stack context.
 *
 * The Xenomai scheduler ensures that concurrent tasks are run according
 * to one of the supported scheduling policies. Currently, the Xenomai
 * scheduler supports fixed priority-based FIFO and round-robin
 * policies.

 * @fn int rt_task_create(RT_TASK *task,const char *name,int stksize,int prio,int mode)
 * @brief Create a new real-time task.
 *
 * Creates a real-time task, either running in a kernel module or in
 * user-space depending on the caller's context.
 *
 * @param task The address of a task descriptor Xenomai will use to store
 * the task-related data.  This descriptor must always be valid while
 * the task is active therefore it must be allocated in permanent
 * memory.
 *
 * The task is left in an innocuous state until it is actually started
 * by rt_task_start().
 *
 * @param name An ASCII string standing for the symbolic name of the
 * task. When non-NULL and non-empty, this string is copied to a safe
 * place into the descriptor, and passed to the registry package if
 * enabled for indexing the created task.
 *
 * @param stksize The size of the stack (in bytes) for the new
 * task. If zero is passed, a reasonable pre-defined size will be
 * substituted.
 *
 * @param prio The base priority of the new task. This value must
 * range from [1 .. 99] (inclusive) where 1 is the lowest effective
 * priority.
 *
 * @param mode The task creation mode. The following flags can be
 * OR'ed into this bitmask, each of them affecting the new task:
 *
 * - T_FPU allows the task to use the FPU whenever available on the
 * platform. This flag is forced for user-space tasks.
 *
 * - T_SUSP causes the task to start in suspended mode. In such a
 * case, the thread will have to be explicitly resumed using the
 * rt_task_resume() service for its execution to actually begin.
 *
 * - T_CPU(cpuid) makes the new task affine to CPU # @b cpuid. CPU
 * identifiers range from 0 to RTHAL_NR_CPUS - 1 (inclusive).
 *
 * - T_JOINABLE (user-space only) allows another task to wait on the
 * termination of the new task. This implies that rt_task_join() is
 * actually called for this task to clean up any user-space located
 * resources after its termination.
 *
 * Passing T_FPU|T_CPU(1) in the @a mode parameter thus creates a task
 * with FPU support enabled and which will be affine to CPU #1.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -ENOMEM is returned if the system fails to get enough dynamic
 * memory from the global real-time heap in order to create or
 * register the task.
 *
 * - -EEXIST is returned if the @a name is already in use by some
 * registered object.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service was called from an
 * asynchronous context.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: possible.

/**
 * @fn int rt_task_set_mode(int clrmask,int setmask,int *mode_r)
 * @brief Change task mode bits.
 *
 * Each Xenomai task has a set of internal bits determining various
 * operating conditions; the rt_task_set_mode() service allows to
 * alter three of them, respectively controlling:
 *
 * - whether the task locks the rescheduling procedure,
 * - whether the task undergoes a round-robin scheduling,
 * - whether the task blocks the delivery of signals.
 *
 * To this end, rt_task_set_mode() takes a bitmask of mode bits to
 * clear for disabling the corresponding modes, and another one to set
 * for enabling them. The mode bits which were previously in effect
 * can be returned upon request.
 *
 * The following bits can be part of the bitmask:
 *
 * - T_LOCK causes the current task to lock the scheduler. Clearing
 * this bit unlocks the scheduler.
 *
 * - T_RRB causes the current task to be marked as undergoing the
 * round-robin scheduling policy. If the task is already undergoing
 * the round-robin scheduling policy at the time this service is
 * called, the time quantum remains unchanged.
 *
 * - T_NOSIG disables the asynchronous signal delivery for the current
 * task.
 *
 * - T_SHIELD enables the interrupt shield for the current user-space
 * task. When engaged, the interrupt shield protects the Xenomai task
 * running in secondary mode from any preemption by the regular Linux
 * interrupt handlers, without delaying in any way the Xenomai
 * interrupt handling. The shield is operated on a per-task basis at
 * each context switch, depending on the setting of this flag. This
 * flag is cleared by default for new user-space tasks. This feature
 * is only available if the CONFIG_XENO_OPT_ISHIELD option has been
 * enabled at configuration time; otherwise, this flag is simply
 * ignored.
 *
 * - When set, T_WARNSW causes the SIGXCPU signal to be sent to the
 * current user-space task whenever it switches to the secondary
 * mode. This feature is useful to detect unwanted migrations to the
 * Linux domain.
 *
 * - T_RPIOFF disables thread priority coupling between Xenomai and
 * Linux schedulers. This bit prevents the root Linux thread from
 * inheriting the priority of the running shadow Xenomai thread. Use
 * CONFIG_XENO_OPT_RPIOFF to globally disable priority coupling.
 *
 * - T_PRIMARY can be passed to switch the current user-space task to
 * primary mode (setmask |= T_PRIMARY), or secondary mode (clrmask |=
 * T_PRIMARY). Upon return from rt_task_set_mode(), the user-space
 * task will run into the specified domain.
 *
 * Normally, this service can only be called on behalf of a regular
 * real-time task, either running in kernel or user-space. However, as
 * a special exception, requests for setting/clearing the T_LOCK bit
 * from asynchronous contexts are silently dropped, and the call
 * returns successfully if no other mode bits have been
 * specified. This is consistent with the fact that Xenomai enforces a
 * scheduler lock until the outer interrupt handler has returned.
 *
 * @param clrmask A bitmask of mode bits to clear for the current
 * task, before @a setmask is applied. 0 is an acceptable value which
 * leads to a no-op.
 *
 * @param setmask A bitmask of mode bits to set for the current
 * task. 0 is an acceptable value which leads to a no-op.
 *
 * @param mode_r If non-NULL, @a mode_r must be a pointer to a memory
 * location which will be written upon success with the previous set
 * of active mode bits. If NULL, the previous set of active mode bits
 * will not be returned.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success, or:
 *
 * - -EINVAL if either @a setmask or @a clrmask specifies invalid
 * bits. T_PRIMARY is invalid for kernel-based tasks.

 * will be made available "as is" to the remote task into the

 * field by the rt_task_send() service. If @a mcb_s is NULL, 0 will be
 * returned to the client into the status code field.
