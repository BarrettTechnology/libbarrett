 * Condition variable services.
 *
 * A condition variable is a synchronization object which allows tasks
 * to suspend execution until some predicate on shared data is
 * satisfied. The basic operations on conditions are: signal the
 * condition (when the predicate becomes true), and wait for the
 * condition, blocking the task execution until another task signals
 * the condition.  A condition variable must always be associated with
 * a mutex, to avoid a well-known race condition where a task prepares
 * to wait on a condition variable and another task signals the
 * condition just before the first task actually waits on it.
