 * \fn int rt_intr_create (RT_INTR *intr,const char *name,unsigned irq,rt_isr_t isr,rt_iack_t iack,int mode)
 * \brief Create an interrupt object from kernel space.
 *
 * Initializes and associates an interrupt object with an IRQ line. In
 * kernel space, interrupts are immediately notified to a user-defined
 * handler or ISR (interrupt service routine).
 *
 * When an interrupt occurs on the given @a irq line, the ISR is fired
 * in order to deal with the hardware event. The interrupt service
 * code may call any non-suspensive Xenomai service.
 *
 * Upon receipt of an IRQ, the ISR is immediately called on behalf of
 * the interrupted stack context, the rescheduling procedure is
 * locked, and the interrupt source is masked at hardware level. The
 * status value returned by the ISR is then checked for the following
 * values:
 *
 * - RT_INTR_HANDLED indicates that the interrupt request has been fulfilled
 * by the ISR.
 *
 * - RT_INTR_NONE indicates the opposite to RT_INTR_HANDLED. The ISR must always
 * return this value when it determines that the interrupt request has not been
 * issued by the dedicated hardware device.
 *
 * In addition, one of the following bits may be set by the ISR :
 *
 * NOTE: use these bits with care and only when you do understand their effect
 * on the system.
 * The ISR is not encouraged to use these bits in case it shares the IRQ line
 * with other ISRs in the real-time domain.
 *
 * - RT_INTR_PROPAGATE tells Xenomai to require the real-time control
 * layer to forward the IRQ. For instance, this would cause the Adeos
 * control layer to propagate the interrupt down the interrupt
 * pipeline to other Adeos domains, such as Linux. This is the regular
 * way to share interrupts between Xenomai and the Linux kernel.
 *
 * - RT_INTR_NOENABLE asks Xenomai not to re-enable the IRQ line upon return
 * of the interrupt service routine.
 *
 * A count of interrupt receipts is tracked into the interrupt
 * descriptor, and reset to zero each time the interrupt object is
 * attached. Since this count could wrap around, it should be used as
 * an indication of interrupt activity only.
 *
 * @param intr The address of a interrupt object descriptor Xenomai will
 * use to store the object-specific data.  This descriptor must always
 * be valid while the object is active therefore it must be allocated
 * in permanent memory.
 *
 * @param name An ASCII string standing for the symbolic name of the
 * interrupt object. When non-NULL and non-empty, this string is copied
 * to a safe place into the descriptor, and passed to the registry package
 * if enabled for indexing the created interrupt objects.
 *
 * @param irq The hardware interrupt channel associated with the
 * interrupt object. This value is architecture-dependent.
 *
 * @param isr The address of a valid interrupt service routine in
 * kernel space. This handler will be called each time the
 * corresponding IRQ is delivered on behalf of an interrupt context.
 * A pointer to an internal information is passed to the routine which
 * can use it to retrieve the descriptor address of the associated
 * interrupt object through the I_DESC() macro.
 *
 * @param iack The address of an optional interrupt acknowledge
 * routine, aimed at replacing the default one. Only very specific
 * situations actually require to override the default setting for
 * this parameter, like having to acknowledge non-standard PIC
 * hardware. @a iack should return a non-zero value to indicate that
 * the interrupt has been properly acknowledged. If @a iack is NULL,
 * the default routine will be used instead.
 *
 * @param mode The interrupt object creation mode. The following flags can be
 * OR'ed into this bitmask, each of them affecting the new interrupt object:
 *
 * - I_SHARED enables IRQ-sharing with other interrupt objects.
 *
 * - I_EDGE is an additional flag need to be set together with I_SHARED
 * to enable IRQ-sharing of edge-triggered interrupts.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -ENOMEM is returned if the system fails to get enough dynamic
 * memory from the global real-time heap in order to register the
 * interrupt object.
 *
 * - -EBUSY is returned if the interrupt line is already in use by
 * another interrupt object. Only a single interrupt object can be
 * associated to any given interrupt line using rt_intr_create() at
 * any time.
 *
 * - -EEXIST is returned if @a irq is already associated to an
 * existing interrupt object.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service was called from an
 * asynchronous context.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: possible.
 *
 * @note The interrupt source associated to the interrupt descriptor
 * remains masked upon creation. rt_intr_enable() should be called for
 * the new interrupt object to unmask it.

 *
 * Initializes and associates an interrupt object with an IRQ line
