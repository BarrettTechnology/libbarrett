 * representing the period of the timer, i.e. the duration of a
 * periodic tick or "jiffy".

/**
 * @fn int rt_timer_set_mode(RTIME nstick)
 * @brief Set the system clock rate.
 *
 * This routine switches to periodic timing mode and sets the clock
 * tick rate, or resets the current timing mode to aperiodic/oneshot
 * mode depending on the value of the @a nstick parameter. Since the
 * native skin automatically sets its time base according to the
 * configured policy and period at load time (see
 * CONFIG_XENO_OPT_NATIVE_PERIOD), calling rt_timer_set_mode() is not
 * required from applications unless the pre-defined mode and period
 * need to be changed dynamically.
 *
 * This service sets the time unit which will be relevant when
 * specifying time intervals to the services taking timeout or delays
 * as input parameters. In periodic mode, clock ticks will represent
 * periodic jiffies. In oneshot mode, clock ticks will represent
 * nanoseconds.
 *
 * @param nstick The time base period in nanoseconds. If this
 * parameter is equal to the special TM_ONESHOT value, the time base
 * is set to operate in a tick-less fashion (i.e. oneshot mode). Other
 * values are interpreted as the time between two consecutive clock
 * ticks in periodic timing mode (i.e. clock HZ = 1e9 / nstick).
 *
 * @return 0 is returned on success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -ENODEV is returned if the underlying architecture does not
 * support the requested periodic timing. Aperiodic/oneshot timing is
 * always supported.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: never.
