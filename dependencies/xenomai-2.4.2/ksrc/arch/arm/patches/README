-- arch/arm/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and
deterministic response time to external interrupts, and also to
provide real-time services highly integrated with the standard Linux
kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

Apply one of the patches found in this directory to the corresponding
kernel release. You may want to have a look at the README.*INSTALL
guides at the top of the Xenomai tree for more information.
