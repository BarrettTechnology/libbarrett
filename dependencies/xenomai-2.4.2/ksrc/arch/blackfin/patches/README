-- arch/blackfin/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

On the Blackfin architecture, Xenomai is supported on the the BF533,
BF537 and BF561(*) boards, based on the uClinux releases published by
the Blackfin project [2] for kernels prior to 2.6.23, and mainline
kernels beyond.

Just apply the provided patch against the corresponding kernel
release. You may want to have a look at the README.*INSTALL guides at
the top of the Xenomai tree for more information.

(*) Starting from kernel 2.6.23.
