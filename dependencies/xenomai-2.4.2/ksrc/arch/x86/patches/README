-- arch/x86/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

On the i386 architecture, Xenomai is supported on both the v2.4 and
v2.6 Linux kernel series, for which the appropriate Adeos patches
exist. Xenomai supports the x86_64 architecture starting with the v2.6
Linux kernel series.

Apply one of the patches found into this directory against the
corresponding kernel release. You may want to have a look at the
README.*INSTALL guides at the top of the Xenomai tree for more
information.
