.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxeno-config\fP is a script that is used to to display the compiler and linker flags that are required for building applications that use Xenomai.
Any combination of options can be chosen (except \fB\-\-verbose\fP and \fB\-\-help\fP) to display configuration information, and options can be given in any order.
The command output one line for each option, in the same order as the options.

When \fBxeno-config \-\-verbose\fP is executed, all configuration information is displayed in a different, more human-readable format.

When \fBxeno-config\fP is executed without any options, the output is equivalent to than when executing \fBxeno-config \-\-verbose\fP then \fBxeno-config \-\-help\fP.

.\" ********************************************************************
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-v, \-\-verbose
Outputs all configuration information, in a human-readable format.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Outputs the list of available command-line options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Outputs one line with the installed Xenomai version.
.TP
.B \-\-cc
Outputs one line with the path to the C compiler command that was used to compiled Xenomai.
.TP
.B \-\-arch
Outputs one line with the architecture to compile to, e.g. i386.
May be different from the architecture of the currently running system, if cross-compiling.
.TP
.B \-\-prefix
Outputs one line with the absolute path to the base Xenomai installation directory.
.TP
.B \-\-xeno\-cflags
Outputs one line with the C compiler command-line options that are necessary to compile applications that use the Xenomai libraries.
.TP
.B \-\-xeno\-ldflags
Outputs one line with the C compiler command-line options that are necessary to link applications against the Xenomai libraries.
.TP
.B \-\-posix\-cflags
Outputs one line with the C compiler command-line options that are necessary to compile applications that use Xenomai's Posix-compatible layer library.
.TP
.B \-\-posix\-ldflags
Outputs one line with the C compiler command-line options that are necessary to link applications against Xenomai's Posix-compatible layer library.
.TP
.B \-\-lib*\-dir, \-\-library\-dir, \-\-libdir, \-\-user\-libdir
Outputs one line with the absolute path to Xenomai's libraries.
In the \fB\-\-lib*\-dir\fP option name, the \fB*\fP is meant as a wildcard: \fB\-\-lib\-dir\fP, \fB\-\-libfoo\-dir\fP and \fB\-\-libbar\-dir\fP are all valid and synonymous options.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B DESTDIR
If the \fBDESTDIR\fP variable is set, its content is prepended to the Xenomai installed directories and files names output by the
\fB\-\-prefix\fP and \fB\-\-library\-dir\fP options, and to the Xenomai installation directories in the flags output by the
\fB\-\-xeno\-cflags\fP, \fB\-\-xeno\-ldflags\fP, \fB\-\-posix\-cflags\fP, \fB\-\-posix\-ldflags\fP
options.

If \fBDESTDIR\fP was set when compiling and installing Xenomai, e.g. for cross-compilation, \fBDESTDIR\fP must be set to the same value before calling \fBxeno-config\fP, in order to output valid directory and file names.
.SH "RETURN CODES"
.TP
.B 0
Successful script execution.
.TP
.B 1
The
.B \-\-posix\-ldflags
option has been given but Posix support is not available in Xenomai;
or an invalid argument has been given on the command-line.
