.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxeno\-test\fP measures the performance of Xenomai, by executing Xenomai's \fBlatency\fP tests while generating a high workload on the system.
The default command that is executed to simulate workload (if no alternate command is specified with a \fB-W\fP \fIcommand\fP option) is:
.RS
.sp
.B dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null
.sp
.RE
The executed \fBlatency\fP tests periodically (every second) sample and print out the minimum, average, and maximum latency.
However, by default, if no option is specified to \fBxeno\-test\fP, those tests are executed with the \fB\-q\fP option (see below), which disables the printing of samples.
If the \fB\-q\fP option is not specified, samples are printed in groups separated by headers.
In addition, \fBlatency\fP print statistics for all samples before terminating, and can also optionally print statistics for every group of samples (see the \fB\-s\fP option), and distribution histograms (see the \fB\-h\fP option).

.SH OPTIONS
If an invalid option is specified, \fBxeno\-test\fP prints out an usage help message and exits.

You are strongly encouraged to use the \fB\-m\fP option, to anonymously help the Xenomai team collecting statistics about Xenomai's performance on the widest range of systems.

The following options are specific to \fBxeno\-test\fP:
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Produces more verbose tests results.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIworkloads\fP
The number of workload commands to execute simultaneously. By default, this number is \fB1\fP.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIdevice\fP
If the default workload command is to be executed, sets the input device to be read by \fBdd\fP to \fIdevice\fP instead of \fB/dev/zero\fP.
For instance, specifying the device of a real hard-drive (e.g. \fB/dev/hda1\fP) is useful for generating interrupts with I/O.
The specified \fIdevice\fP must be mounted, and cannot be an NFS mount.
.TP
\fB\-W\fP \fIcommand\fP
Executes the specified \fIcommand\fP to generate workload, instead of the default \fBdd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null\fP command.
If the command requires arguments, the command and its arguments must be quoted and passed as a single \fIcommand\fP argument.
In addition to such static arguments, the \fIargs\fP optional arguments passed to \fBxeno\-test\fP are appended to \fIcommand\fP to execute it. 
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIcommand\fP
Makes \fBxeno\-test\fP execute the specified \fIcommand\fP before and after all the \fBlatency\fP executions. 
.TP
\fB\-L\fP
Activates logging of the tests results.
The log file is created in the \fB/tmp/\fP directory, and is named \fBtest\-\fP\fIkernel_release\fP\fB\-\fP\fItimestamp\fP, where \fIkernel_release\fP is the release number of the running Linux kernel (as determined by executing \fBuname \-r\fP), and \fItimestamp\fP is a textual representation of the current date and time (as determined by executing \fBdate\fP) used to reduce the risk of file name collisions.
The log file name can be customized by using the \fB\-N\fP option instead of, or in conjunction with this option.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP \fIprefix\fP
Activates logging of the tests results.
If the \fB\-L\fP option is also specified, prepends \fIprefix\fP to the log file name, hence the log file name is \fIprefix\fP\fBtest\-\fP\fIkernel_release\fP\fB\-\fP\fItimestamp\fP.
If the \fB\-L\fP option is not specified, the log file name is \fIprefix\fP\fB\-\fP\fItimestamp\fP.
This option is useful to create the log file in a different directory than \fB/tmp/\fP (default prefix when using the \fB\-L\fP option), by specifying a \fIprefix\fP which starts with an absolute directory path or a directory path relative to the working directory.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
Sends the tests results to the Xenomai team's email address (\fBxenotest.output@gmail.com\fP), to help collecting statistics about Xenomai's performance. The email is sent using the system's \fBmail\fP command. The email's sender address is \fBxenotest.sender@xenomai.org\fP, and the email's subject is \fB"xeno-test results"\fP.
.TP
\fB\-M\fP \fIemail\fP
Similar to the \fB\-m\fP option, but sends the tests results to the specified email address instead of the default one.
.TP
\fB\-U\fP \fIurl\fP
Uploads the tests results to the specified URL.
If there is no file part in the specified \fIurl\fP, and the \fB\-L\fP or \fB\-N\fP option is also specified, the log file name is appended to it to form the URL used for upload.
The tests results are transmitted as the contents of an HTTP request using the PUT method.
The upload is performed using the \fBcurl\fP command.
This option fails silently (i.e. the tests results are not sent) if \fBcurl\fP is not available.
.PP
The following options are directly passed to the \fBlatency\fP test command executed by \fBxeno\-test\fP.
If no such options are specified, the \fB\-s \-T 120 \-q\fP options are implicitly passed by default by \fBxeno\-test\fP.
Any user-specified set of options overrides this default set of options.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
Displays statistics (minimum, average, and maximum latencies) for every group of samples.
The number of samples in each group is determined by the \fB\-l\fP \fIsamples\fP option (default is \fB21\fP samples).
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIsamples\fP
The number of samples in every group of samples.
This number is the number of sample lines displayed between every header line, and is the number of samples used to calculate intermediate statistics if the \fB\-s\fP option is specified.
By default, this number is \fB21\fP.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Displays histograms of all sampled data, at the end of tests.
The number of categories - or value intervals - of each histogram is determined by the \fB\-H\fP \fIcategories\fP option (default is \fB100\fP categories).
The granularity - or bucket size -, used to separate latency samples into categories, is determined by the \fB\-B\fP \fIgranularity\fP option (default is \fB1000\fP ns).
This option implies \fB\-s\fP.
.TP
\fB\-H\fP \fIcategories\fP
The number of categories - or value intervals - of histograms to display if the \fB\-h\fP option is specified.
By default, this number is \fB100\fP. 
.TP
\fB\-B\fP \fIgranularity\fP
The granularity - or bucket size -, in nanoseconds, used to discriminate between the categories of latency samples in histograms (to be printed if the \fB\-h\fP option is specified).
By default, this number is \fB1000\fP ns.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP \fIseconds\fP
The period, in seconds, during which \fBlatency\fP tests are executed.
If that option is not specified, the tests execute infinitely until the user types \fBCONTROL-C\fP (i.e. sends a SIGINT signal to them).
.TP
\fB\-q\fP
Disables the printing of samples and sample group statistics (hence this overrides the \fB\-s\fP option), and only global statistics and histograms are being printed.
The default behaviour, if this option is not specified, is to display every sample (measured minimum, average, and maximum latency) and optionally sample group statistics (if \fB\-s\fP is specified).
.TP
.B \-\-
Indicates the end of options.
This must be specified before \fIargs\fP arguments if the first argument starts with \fB\-\fP, so that it is not considered as an option.
.PP
.SH "RETURN CODES"
.TP
.B 0
The tests executed successfully.
.TP
.B 1
An invalid option was specified.
.SH KNOWN BUGS
\fBlatency\fP allows to specify the \fB\-H\fP \fIcategories\fP and \fB\-B\fP \fIgranularity\fP options without the \fB\-h\fP option, in which case they have no effect.

It is possible to specify the period between samples (default is \fB1 second\fP) using the \fBlatency\fP command's \fB\-p\fP option, but this option cannot be passed through \fBxeno-test\fP (this conflicts with \fBxeno-test\fP's own \fB\-p\fP option).

The workload generation task (e.g., the default \fBdd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null\fP command) may terminate before the tests are finished, which may produce inaccurate tests results. It may be necessary to specify an alternate command which lasts longer, using the \fB-W\fP \fIcommand\fP option.

Workload processes may not be properly killed when \fBxeno-test\fP terminate.
