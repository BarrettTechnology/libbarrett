      GNU/Linux can favour a wider acceptance of the latter as a
      real-time embedded platform. Providing emulators to mimic the
      traditional RTOS APIs is one of the initiative the free software
      community can take to fill the gap between the very fragmented
      traditional RTOS world and the GNU/Linux world, in order for the
      application designers relying on traditional RTOS to move as
      smoothly as possible to the GNU/</p><p>There is a lack of common software framework for
      developing these emulators, whereas the behavioural similarities
      between the traditional RTOS are obvious.</p><p>The Xenomai technology aims at fulfilling this gap, by
      providing a consistent architecture-neutral and generic
      emulation layer taking advantage of these similarities. It is
      also committed to provide an increasing set of traditional RTOS
      emulators built on top of this layer.</p><p>Xenomai relies on the common features and behaviours found
      between many embedded traditional RTOS, especially from the
      thread scheduling and synchronization standpoints. These
      similarities are exploited to implement a nucleus exporting a
      set of generic services. These services grouped in a high-level
      interface can be used in turn to implement emulation modules of
      real-time application programming interfaces, which mimic the
      corresponding real-time kernel APIs.</p><p>A similar approach was used for the <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/carbonkernel/" target="_top">CarbonKernel</a>
      project [1] in the simulation field, in which RTOS simulation
      models are built on top of a generic virtual RTOS based on
      event-driven techniques. </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="porting-rtos"></a>1.2. Porting traditional RTOS-based applications to GNU/Linux</h3></div></div></div><p>The idea of using GNU/Linux as an embedded system
      with real-time capabilities is not novel. The reader can refer
      to Jerry Epplin's article in the October 97 issue of Embedded
      Systems Programming for a discussion about GNU/Linux potential
      in the embedded field [2].</p><p>Throughout this document, we will use the expression
      <span class="emphasis"><em>source RTOS</em></span> to indicate the traditional
      real-time operating from which the application is to be ported,
      and <span class="emphasis"><em>target OS</em></span> to indicate GNU/Linux or any
      other free operating system to which the application could be
      ported.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="highlevel-code"></a>1.2.1. <span class="level3">Limited high-level code modification</span></h4></div></div></div><p>Keeping the initial design and implementation of a hard
	real-time application when attempting to port it to another
	architecture is obviously of the greatest
	interest. Reliability and performance may have been obtained
	after a long, complex and costly engineering process one does
	not want to compromise. Consequently, the best situation is to
	have the closest possible equivalence between the source and
	destination RTOS programming interfaces, as far as both the
	syntax and the semantics are concerned.</p><p>An illustration of this can be taken from the support of
	a priority inheritance protocol [3] by the mutual exclusion
	services. These services allow concurrent threads to protect
	themselves from race conditions that could occur into critical
	sections of code. The purpose of this discussion is not to
	argue whether relying on priority inheritance for resolving
	priority inversion problems is a major design flaw or a
	necessary safety belt for a real-time application, but only to
	emphasize that any cases, if this feature is used in the
	source RTOS, but not available from the target OS, the
	resource management strategy must be reevaluated for the
	application, since priority inversion risks will
	exists.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="rtos-compat"></a>1.2.2. RTOS behavioural compatibility</h4></div></div></div><p>During the past years, major embedded RTOS, such as
	VRTX, VxWorks, pSOS+ and a few others, have implemented a
	real-time kernel behaviour which has become a de facto
	standard, notably for thread scheduling, inter-thread
	synchronization, and asynchronous event management. To
	illustrate this, let us talk about a specific concern in the
	interrupt service management.</p><p>A well-known behaviour of such RTOS is to lock the
	rescheduling procedure until the outer interrupt service
	routine (or ISR) - called first upon possibly nested
	interrupts - has exited, after which a global rescheduling is
	finally stated. This way, an interrupt service routine
	can always assume that no synchronous thread activity may run
	until it has exited. Moreover, all changes impacting the
	scheduling order of threads, due to actions taken by any
	number of nested ISRs (e.g. signaling a synchronization object
	on which one or more threads are pending) are considered once
	and conjunctively, instead of disjunctively.</p><p>For instance, if a suspended thread is first resumed by
	an ISR, then forcibly suspended later by another part of the
	same ISR, the outcome will be that the thread will not run,
	and remain suspended after the ISR has exited. In the other
	hand, if the RTOS sees ISRs as non-specific code that can be
	preempted by threads, the considered thread will be given the
	opportunity to execute immediately after it is resumed, until
	it is suspended anew. Obviously, the respective resulting
	situations won't be identical.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="reevalutation"></a>1.2.3. Reevaluation of the real-time constraints</h4></div></div></div><p>Making GNU/Linux a hard real-time system is currently
	achieved by using a co-kernel approach which takes control of
	the hardware interrupt management, and allows running
	real-time tasks seamlessly aside of the hosting GNU/Linux
	system [4]. The 'regular' Linux kernel is eventually seen as a
	low-priority, background of the small real-time executive. The
	<a href="http://www.rtlinux.org" target="_top">RTLinux</a> project
	is representative of this technical path. However, this
	approach has a major drawback when it comes to port complex
	applications from a foreign software platform: since the
	real-time tasks run outside the Linux kernel control, the
	GNU/Linux programming model cannot be preserved when porting
	these applications. The result is an increased complexity in
	redesigning and debugging the ported code.</p><p>In some cases, choosing a traditional RTOS to run an
	embedded application has been initially dictated by the memory
	constraints imposed by the target hardware, instead of actual
	real-time constraints imposed by the application itself. Since
	embedded devices tend to exhibit ever increasing memory and
	processing horsepower, it seems judicious to reevaluate the
	need for real-time guarantee when considering the porting
	effort to GNU/Linux on a new target hardware. This way, the
	best underlying software architecture can be selected. In this
	respect, the following, the following criteria need to be
	considered:

	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Determinism and
	      criticality.</em></span></p><p>What is the worst
	      case interrupt and dispatch latencies needed
	      ?</p><p>Does a missed deadline lead to a
	      catastrophic failure ?</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Programming model</em></span></p><p>What is the overall application complexity,
	      provided that the higher the complexity, the greater
	      the need for powerful debugging aid and monitoring
	      tools.</p></li><li><p>Is there a need need for low-level hardware
	      control ? </p><p>Is the real-time activity
	      coupled to non real-time services, such as GUI or
	      databases, requiring sophisticated communications with
	      the non real-time world ?</p></li></ul></div><p>
	</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="existing-solutions"></a>1.2.4. Some existing solutions</h4></div></div></div><p>In order to get whether hard or soft real-time support,
	several GNU/Linux-based solutions exist [5][6]. It is not the
	purpose of this paper to present them all exhaustively. We
	will only consider a two fold approach based on free software
	solutions which is likely to be suited for many porting
	taskings, depending on the actual real-time constraints
	imposed by the application.</p><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="partial-rewriting"></a>1.2.4.1. Partial rewriting using a real-time GNU/Linux
	  extension</h5></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Real-time enabling GNU/Linux using
	  RTAI.</em></span> Strictly speaking Linux/RTAI [7] is not a
	  real-time operating system but rather a real-time Linux
	  kernel extension, which allows running real-time tasks
	  seamlessly aside of the hosting GNU/Linux system. The RTAI
	  co-kernel shares hardware interrupts and system-originated
	  events like traps and faults with the Linux kernel using the
	  <a href="http://www.adeos.org/" target="_top">Adeos</a>
	  virtualization layer, which in turn ensures RTAI low
	  interrupt latencies. The native RTAI API provides the
	  applications a wealth of useful services, including counting
	  semaphores, POSIX 1003.1-1996 facilities such as pthreads,
	  mutexes and condition variables, also adding remote
	  procedure call facility, mailboxes, and precision
	  timers. Most services are symmetrically available from
	  kernel module and user-space programs.</p><p>RTAI 2.x and 3.x provide a means to execute hard
	  real-time tasks in user-space context (x86 only), but still
	  outside the Linux kernel control, which is best described as
	  running 'user-space kernel modules'. This feature, namely
	  LXRT, is a major step toward a simpler migration path from
	  traditional RTOS, since programming errors occuring within
	  real-time tasks don't jeopardize the overall GNU/Linux
	  system sanity, at the expense of a few microseconds more
	  latency.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Ad hoc services emulation.</em></span> A first
	  approach consists in emulating each real-time facility
	  needed by the application using a combination of the RTAI
	  services. An ad hoc wrapping interface has to be written to
	  support the needed function calls. The benefit of the
	  wrapping approach lies in the limited modifications made to
	  the original code. However, some RTAI behaviours may not be
	  compliant with the source operating system's. For the very
	  same reason, conflicts between the emulated and native RTAI
	  services may occur in some way.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Complete port to RTAI.</em></span> A second
	  approach consists in fully porting the application over the
	  native RTAI API. In such a case, RTAI facilities are
	  globally substituted from the facilities from the source
	  RTOS. This solution brings improved consistency at the
	  expense of a possible large-scale rewriting of the
	  application, due to some fundamental behavioural differences
	  that may exist between the traditional RTOS and the native
	  RTAI interface.</p></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="uspace-emul"></a>1.2.4.2. Unconstrained user-space emulations</h5></div></div></div><p>A few traditional RTOS emulators exists in the free
	  software world. There are generally designed on top of the
	  GNU/Linux POSIX 1003.1-1996 layer, and allow to emulate the
	  source RTOS API in a user-space execution context, under the
	  control of the Linux kernel.</p><p>Once one of the most proeminent effort in this area
	  used to be the Legacy2linux project [8]. This project,
	  sponsored by Montavista Software, aimed at providing
	  [<span class="citation">"a series of Linux-resident emulators for various
	  legacy RTOS kernels."</span>] Just like Xenomai,
	  [<span class="citation">these emulators are designed to ease the task of
	  porting legacy RTOS code to an embedded Linux
	  environment".</span>] Two emulators have been made
	  available by this project, respectively mimicking the APIs
	  of WindRiver's pSOS+ and VxWorks real-time operating
	  systems. However, this project has stalled due to a lack of
	  maintenance and contribution. </p><p>The benefits of this approach is mainly to keep the
	  development process in the GNU/Linux user-space environment,
	  instead of moving to a rather 'hostile' kernel/supervisor
	  mode context. This way, the rich set of existing tools such
	  as debuggers, code profilers, and monitors usable in this
	  context are immediatly available to the application
	  developer. Moreover, the standard GNU/Linux programming
	  model is preserved, allowing the application to use the full
	  set of of facilities existing in the user space (e.g. full
	  POSIX support, including inter-process communication). Last
	  but not least, programming errors occuring in this context
	  don't jeopardize the overall GNU/Linux system stability,
	  unlike what can happen if a bug is encountered on behalf of
	  a hard real-time RTAI task which could cause serious damages
	  to the running Linux kernel.
	  </p><p>However, we can see at least three problems in using
	  these emulators, depending on the application constraints:
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>First, the emulated API they provide is usually
		incomplete for an easy port from the source RTOS. In
		other words, only a limited syntactic compatibility is
		available.</p></li><li><p>Second, the exact behaviour of the source RTOS is
		not reproduced for all the functional areas. In other
		words, the semantic compatibility might not be
		guaranteed.</p></li><li><p>These emulators don't share any common code base
		for implementing the fundamental real-time behaviours,
		even so both pSOS+ and VxWorks share most of them. The
		resulting situation leads to redundant implementation
		efforts, without any benefit one can see in code
		mutualization.</p></li><li><p>And finally, even combined to the latest Linux
		2.6 features like fine-grain kernel preemption and low
		latency efforts, these emulators cannot deliver
		deterministic real-time performance.</p></li></ul></div><p>
	</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="common-framework"></a>1.3. A common emulation framework</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="rtos-behaviours"></a>1.3.1. Common traditional RTOS behaviours</h4></div></div></div><p>In order to build a generic and versatile framework for
	emulating traditional RTOS, we chose to concentrate on a set
	of common behaviours they all exhibit. A limited set of
	specific RTOS features which are not so common, but would be
	more efficiently implemented into the nucleus than into the
	emulators, has also been retained. The basic behaviours
	selected cover four distinct fields:</p><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="multi-threading"></a>1.3.1.1. Multi-threading</h5></div></div></div><p>Multi-threading provides the fundamental mechanism for
	  an application to control and react to multiple, discrete
	  external events. The nucleus provides the basic
	  multi-threading environment.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Thread states.</em></span> The nucleus has to
	  maintain the current state of each thread in the system. A
	  state transition from one state to another may occur as the
	  result of specific nucleus services called by the RTOS
	  emulator. The fundamental thread states defined by the
	  nucleus are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>DORMANT and SUSPENDED states are cumulative,
		meaning that the newly created thread will still
		remain in a suspended state after being resumed from
		the DORMANT state.</p></li><li><p>PENDING and SUSPENDED states are cumulative too,
		meaning that a thread can be forcibly suspended by
		another thread or service routine while pending on a
		synchronization resource (e.g. semaphore, message
		queue). In such a case, the resource is dispatched to
		it, but it remains suspended until explicitely resumed
		by the proper nucleus service.</p></li><li><p>PENDING and DELAYED states may be combined to
		express a timed wait on a resource. In such a case,
		the time the thread can be blocked is bound to a limit
		enforced by a watchdog.</p></li></ul></div><p>
	</p><p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Scheduling policies</em></span>. By default,
	  threads are scheduled according to a fixed priority value,
	  using a preemptive algorithm. There is also a support for
	  round-robin scheduling among a group of threads having the
	  same priority, allowing them to run during a given time
	  slice, in rotation. Moreover, each thread undergoing the
	  round-robin scheduling is given an individual time
	  quantum.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Priority management.</em></span> It is
	  possible to use either an increasing or decreasing thread
	  priority ordering, depending on an initial configuration. In
	  other words, numerically higher priority values could
	  either represent higher or lower scheduling priorities
	  depending on the configuration chosen. This feature is
	  motivated by the existence of this two possible ordering
	  among traditional RTOS. For instance, VxWorks, VRTX, ThreadX
	  and Chorus O/S use a reversed priority management scheme,
	  where the higher the value, the lower the priority. pSOS+
	  instead uses the opposite ordering, in which the higher the
	  value, the higher the priority.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Running thread.</em></span> At any given
	  time, the highest priority thread which has been ready to
	  run for the longest time among the currently runnable
	  threads (i.e. not currently blocked by any delay or resource
	  wait) is elected to run by the scheduler.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Preemption.</em></span> When preempted by a
	  higher priority thread, the running thread is put at the front
	  of the ready thread queue waiting for the processor
	  resource, provided it has not been suspended or blocked in
	  any way. Thus it is expected to regain the processor
	  resource as soon as no other higher priority activity (i.e. a
	  thread having a higher priority level, or an interrupt
	  service routine) is eligible for running.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Manual round-robin.</em></span> As a
	  side-effect of attempting to resume an already runnable
	  thread or the running thread itself, this thread is moved at
	  the end of its priority group in the ready thread
	  queue. This operation is functionally equivalent to a manual
	  round-robin scheduling.</p><p>Even if they are not as widespread as those above in
	  traditional RTOS, the following features are also retained
	  for the sake of efficiency in the implementation of some
	  emulators:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Priority inversion.</em></span> In order to
	  provide support for preventing priority inversion when using
	  inter-thread synchronization services, the priority
	  inheritance protocol is supported.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Signaling.</em></span> A support for sending
	  signals to threads and running asynchronous service routines
	  to process them is available. The asynchronous service
	  routine is run on behalf of the signaled thread context the
	  next time it returns from the nucleus level of execution, as
	  soon as one or more signals are pending.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Disjunctive wait.</em></span> A thread is
	  able to wait in a disjunctive manner on multiple
	  resources. The nucleus unblocks the thread when at least one
	  of the pending resources is available.</p></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="thread-synchro"></a>1.3.1.2. Thread synchronization</h5></div></div></div><p>Traditional RTOS provide a large spectrum of
	  inter-thread communication facilities involving thread
	  synchronization, such as semaphores, message queues, event
	  flags or mailboxes. Looking at them closely, we can define
	  the characteristics of a basic mechanism which will be
	  usable in turn to build these facilities.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Pending mode.</em></span> The thread
	  synchronization facility provides a means for threads to pend
	  either by priority or FIFO ordering. Multiple threads should
	  be able to pend on a single resource.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Priority inheritance protocol.</em></span> In
	  order to prevent priority inversion problems, the thread
	  synchronization facility implements a priority inheritance
	  protocol in conjunction with the thread scheduler. The
	  implementation allows for supporting the priority ceiling
	  protocol as a derivative of the priority inheritance
	  protocol.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Time-bounded wait.</em></span> The thread
	  synchronization facility provides a means to limit the time a
	  thread waits for a given resource using a watchdog.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Forcible deletion.</em></span> It is legal to
	  destroy a resource while threads are pending on it. This
	  action resumes all waiters atomically.</p></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="it-management"></a>1.3.1.3. Interrupt management</h5></div></div></div><p>Since the handling of interrupts is one of the least
	  well defined areas in RTOS design, the nucleus focuses on
	  providing a simple mechanism with sufficient hooks for
	  specific implementations to be built onto according to the
	  emulated RTOS flavour.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Nesting.</em></span> Interrupt management
	  code is reentrant in order to support interrupt nesting
	  safely.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Atomicity.</em></span> Interrupts are
	  associated with dedicated service routines called ISRs. In
	  order for these routines not to be preempted by thread
	  execution, the rescheduling procedure is locked until the
	  outer ISR has exited (i.e. in case of nested
	  interrupts).</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Priority.</em></span> ISRs are always
	  considered as priority over thread execution. Interrupt
	  prioritization is left to the underlying
	  hardware.</p></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="time-management"></a>1.3.1.4. Time management</h5></div></div></div><p>Traditional RTOS usually represent time in units of
	  ticks. These are clock-specific time units and are usually
	  the period of the hardware timer interrupt, or a multiple
	  thereof. Since it needs to support both periodic and
	  aperiodic time sources, the nucleus transparently switches
	  from periodic jiffies to time-stamp counter values depending
	  on the current timer operating mode.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Software timer support.</em></span> A
	  watchdog facility is provided to manage time-bound
	  operations by the nucleus.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Absolute and relative clock.</em></span> The
	  nucleus keeps a global clock value which can be set by the
	  RTOS emulator as being the system-defined epoch.</p><p>Some RTOS like pSOS+ also provide support for
	  date-based timing, but conversion of ticks into conventional
	  time and date units is an uncommon need that should be taken

	exporting a few service classes. These generic services will
	then serve as a founding layer for developing each emulated
	RTOS API, according to their own flavour and semantics.</p><p>In order for this layer to be architecture neutral, the
	needed support for hardware control and real-time capabilities
	will be obtained from an underlying host software
	architecture, through a rather simple standardized
	interface. Thus, porting the nucleus to a new real-time
	architecture will solely consist in implementing this
	low-level interface for the target platform.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="rt-capabilities"></a>1.3.3. Real-time capabilities</h4></div></div></div><p>The host software architecture is expected to provide
	the primary real-time capabilities to the RTOS abstraction
	layer. Basically, the host real-time layer must handle at
	least the following tasks: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>On request start/stop dispatching the external
	      interrupts to a specialized handler ;</p></li><li><p>Provide a means to mask and unmask interrupts ;
	      </p></li><li><p>Provide a means to create new threads of control in
	      their simplest form ; </p></li><li><p>Provide support for periodic and aperiodic
	      interrupt sources used in timer management ; </p></li><li><p>Provide support for allocating chunks of
	      non-pageable memory.</p></li></ul></div><p>

	traditional RTOS to move as smoothly as possible to a
	GNU/Linux-based execution environment, without having to
	rewrite their applications entirely. Aside of the advantages
	of using GNU/Linux as an embedded system, the benefits
	expected from the described approach is mainly a reduced
	complexity in designing new RTOS emulations. The
	architecture-neutral abstraction layer provides the foundation
	for developing accurate emulations of traditional RTOS API,
	saving the burden of repeatedly implementing their fundamental
	real-time behaviours. Since the abstraction layer also favours
	code sharing and mutualization, we can expect the RTOS
	emulations to take advantage of them in terms of code
	stability and reliability.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="nucleus"></a>1.4. Nucleus description</h3></div></div></div><p>RTOS emulations are software modules which connect to
	the nucleus through the pod abstraction. The pod is
	responsible for the critical housekeeping chores, and the
	real-time scheduling of threads.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="multi-threading-support"></a>1.4.1. Multi-threading support</h4></div></div></div><p> The nucleus provides thread object (xnthread) and
	  pod (xnpod) abstractions which exhibit the following
	  characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Threads are scheduled according to a 32bit
		integer priority value, using a preemptive
		algorithm. Priority ordering can be increasing or
		decreasing depending on the pod configuration. </p></li><li><p>A thread can be either waiting for
		initialization, forcibly suspended, pending on a
		resource, delayed for a count of ticks, ready-to-run
		or running.</p></li><li><p>Timed wait for a resource can be bounded by a
		per-thread watchdog.</p></li><li><p>The priority inheritance protocol is supported
		to prevent thread priority inversion when it is
		detected by a synchronization object.</p></li><li><p>A group of threads having the same base priority
		can undergo a round-robin scheduling, each of them
		being given an individual time quantum.</p></li><li><p>A support for sending signals to threads and
		running asynchronous service routines (ASR) to process
		them is built-in.</p></li><li><p>FPU support can be optionally enabled or
		disabled for any thread at creation time.</p></li><li><p>Each thread can enter a disjunctive wait on
		multiple resources.</p></li></ul></div><p>

	  abstraction <span class="emphasis"><em>(xnsynch)</em></span> aimed at
	  implementing the common behaviour of RTOS resources, which
	  has the following characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Support for the priority inheritance protocol,

	  time-related services to the upper interfaces. The timer
	  hardware needs to be configured so that a user-defined routine is called according
	  to a given frequency. On architectures that provide a
	  oneshot-programmable time source, the system timer can
	  operate either in aperiodic or periodic mode. Using the
	  aperiodic mode still allows to run periodic nucleus timers
	  over it: the underlying hardware will simply be reprogrammed
	  after each tick by the timer manager using the appropriate
	  interval value.</p><p>Each incoming clock tick is announced to the timer
	  manager which fires in turn the timeout handlers of elapsed
	  timers. The scheduler itself uses per-thread watchdogs to
	  wake up threads undergoing a bounded time wait, while
	  waiting for a resource availability or being delayed.</p><p>A special care has been taken to offer bounded
	  worst-case time for starting, stopping and maintaining
	  timers. The timer facility is based on the timer wheel
	  algorithm[11] described by Adam M. Costello and George
	  Varghese, which is implemented in the NetBSD operating
	  system for instance.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="memory-allocation"></a>1.4.4. Basic memory allocation</h4></div></div></div><p>Xenomai's nucleus provides dynamic memory allocation
	  support with real-time guarantee, based on McKusick's and
	  Karels' proposal for a general purpose memory
	  allocator[10]. Any number of memory heaps can be maintained
	  dynamically by Xenomai, only limited by the actual amount of
	  system memory.</p></div></div></div></div><hr><p class="copyright">© 2005 Xenomai Project</p><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer" title="Markup validation for this page"><img src="../pictures/w3_xhtml11.png" alt="Standard-compliant XHTML" width="80" height="15"></a><a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer" title="Style Sheet validation for this page"><img src="../pictures/w3_css2.png" alt="Standard-compliant CSS 2" width="80" height="15"></a></body></html>
