README for wamdiscover client

This client has a windows GUI version (wamdiscover.exe)
and a linux command-line version (wamdiscover).
By default, make will compile both versions.

To build the windows version (wamdiscover.exe) from linux,
you must have mingw installed.  From ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install mingw32
